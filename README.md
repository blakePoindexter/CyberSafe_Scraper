This is a web scraper that employs the BeautifulSoup library in Python. It is for my internship with the Carolina Cyber Network and Montreat College. It is used to scrape the local chamber of commerce site and display local business information.
The information can be printed to the screen and written to a CSV file. I am also attempting to call Spiderfoot using the comapny links as well, searching for relevant email addresses.
As of 6/11/2025, it is not complete and needs to be finished, refined, and then optimized.
